### ✍️ About Me :

I have been working with many languages over the years, mostly Java in OOP, but also Python, Go, Groovy, and others. I have spend time building SaaS solutions on K8s, and developing CI/CD pipelines. Solving architectural and engineering problems is a passion of mine, utilizing the right tool and the correct approach, by staying on top of the latest technologies. I work in AWS as a Senior Solutions Architect where I help startups build on AWS. I specialize in OpenSearch, helping customers to fine-tune their workloads and maximize results.
